\index{\(A^\dagger\)}
Let \( A \) be a multivector with j multivector factors,
\( A = B_1 B_2 \cdots B_j \),
not necessarily orthogonal.
The reverse \( A^\dagger \), or reversion, of this multivector \( A \) is
\begin{equation*}
A^\dagger = B_j^\dagger B_{j-1}^\dagger \cdots B_1^\dagger.
\end{equation*}
Scalars and vectors are their own reverse, and
the reverse of a sum of multivectors is the sum of the reversions of its summands.

Examples:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:reverseDefined:21}
\begin{aligned}
\lr{ 1 + 2 \Be_{12} + 3 \Be_{321} }^\dagger &= 1 + 2 \Be_{21} + 3 \Be_{123} \\
\lr{ (1 + \Be_1)(\Be_{23} - \Be_{12}) }^\dagger &= (\Be_{32} + \Be_{12})(1 + \Be_1).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
