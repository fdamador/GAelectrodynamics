      <li>Nicholas Dwark: triple product -&gt; the triple product.  Use scalar triple product and vector triple product where appropriate.</li>
      <li>In the sentence after equation (1.107), “component” is singular, so “lie” should be “lies”.</li>
      <li>(1.103) is described as a bivector-trivector dot product.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I think that e1+2e2 is a vector, and it should be a “vector-trivector” dot product.</li>

      <ul>
          <li>N.D. Foreest: <span class="s1">"in eqs 2.46 en 2.49 I would show first how to compute the product of the two vectors. Then taking the scalar part gives the conclusion of 2.46, but 2.49 becomes much shorter. Like this, the unifying idea of ga becomes also a bit clearer perhaps" </span></li>

          <li>incorporate more feedback from Mo.</li>
          <li>products.tex: split the big hybrid definition into two theorems (dot is scalar selection, vector product has grades 0, 2) and one definition (wedge product).</li>
          <li>fixes for example: products of two unit vectors.</li>

          <li>got rid of contraction axiom reference in the multivector/multivector space intro.</li>
          <li>split out definition of multivector from multivector space. still editing the result, which isn't entirely coherent.</li>

          <li>start incorporating my paper edit notes from first draft createspace print.</li>
