\makedefinition{Vector derivative}{dfn:gradient:100}{
Given a k-parameter vector parameterization
\( \Bx = \Bx(u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_k) \) of \R{N} with \( k \le N \),
and curvilinear basis elements \( \Bx_i = \PDi{u_i}{\Bx} \), the \textit{vector derivative} \( \boldpartial \) is defined as
\begin{equation*}
\boldpartial = \sum_{i=1}^k \Bx^i \partial_i.
\end{equation*}
